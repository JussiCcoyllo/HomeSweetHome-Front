# Real Estate Application
 
The aim of this programming project is to develop a responsive real estate application that serves as a ticketing system to centralize communication and reporting for events within a building. The application will connect four key users: the owner, the tenant, the manager, and the supplier.

## Key Features:
Centralization: The application will serve as a central hub for managing and tracking reported issues within the building.
Communication: Users can communicate within the application and exchange messages, photos, text, and videos related to reported issues.
Reporting: The application generates detailed reports for various activities and events within the building, providing insights and analytics.

## User Roles:
Manager: Responsible for managing reported issues, assigning tasks to suppliers, and ensuring timely resolutions.
Tenant: Refers to the tenant or resident who can report building or service issues and provide relevant details, such as media files and additional text.
Supplier: Represents the supplier or service worker who receives notifications and tasks assigned by the manager for issue resolution.

## Functionality Overview:
All users can report issues through the application, including the ability to add photos, videos, and descriptions.
The manager has the authority to manage and prioritize reported issues, assigning them to the relevant suppliers for resolution and can generate detailed reports for each property.
Suppliers receive notifications for assigned tasks and have access to the necessary information to perform repairs or services.
Tenants can report issues, specify their availability, and grant access to suppliers for issue resolution.

## Programming Language and Tools:

For the implementation of this project, the following technologies will be used:
Spring Boot: A Java-based framework for developing the backend server application.
Angular: A TypeScript-based framework for building the frontend client application.
MySQL: A relational database management system for storing and managing application data.
IDE: IntelliJ, Visual Studio Code, DataGrip

By utilizing these technologies, the application will provide a user-friendly, responsive, and efficient platform for managing, communicating, and reporting issues within the building, thereby improving overall operational efficiency and tenant satisfaction.
